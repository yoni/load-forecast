        <p>
            Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are the largest energy consuming devices in
            most buildings. Wouldn't it be nice if we could forecast how much energy buildings are likely to expend
            HVAC systems over the next 7 days?
        </p>
        <p>
            Leveraging the weather forecast, we estimate heating and cooling load by using
            a concept called heating and cooling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating_degree_day">degree days</a>,
            also known as heating-degree-hours (HDH) and cooling-degree-hours (CDH).
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea is fairly simple. We assume a comfortable temperature, which we call the <strong>balance point</strong>,
            and see how far the forecast temperature will be from that balance point. The number of degrees that the
            actual temperature point falls below the balance point, we call heating
            degrees. Similarly, the  number of degrees that the forecast temperature is above the balance point,
            we call cooling degrees. In both cases, we disallow negative degree-hours, such that there will always be
            zero or more HDHs and CDHs.
            In practice, choosing the right balance point can be tricky. For the sake of this exercise, we'll use 16&deg;C.

                Using weather forecast data from the <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/ndfd/">National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD)</a>,
                we are able to implement the CDH/HDH balance-point algorithm for the continental United States, and plot the
                7-day heating and cooling load forecast. In the implementation, we use positive degree-hours to denote
                heating and negative degree-hours to denote cooling, facilitating a plot which includes both metrics
                in a single view.

                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-down"></span> Caveats:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Read why HDD and CDD methods for estimating load
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating_degree_day#Problems">are inherently problematic</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Due to the fact that we're using raw high resolution forecasts (i.e. 3-6 hour, instead of Day),
                        loads will be skewed by short-term differences in temperature, showing more extreme heating and
                        cooling forecasts. That said, from a certain lens, one might consider this a "feature", since we
                        also benefit from more granular forecasts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The use of a dynamic three-color scale (i.e. blue, white, red) is problematic, since the color scheme will always
                        fit the entire spectrum. I.e. the actual plot intensities will vary by season, and always show
                        a high heating and high cooling regions. Instead, we need to tie color hues to precise values.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A good next step would be to introduce regional average set points for load estimation, using
                        the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=14771">EIA's</a> regional average balance
                        points.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Obviously, we could determine even more accurate load forecasts using state-of-the-art
                        methodologies. If we were doing a deeper analysis, we might consider calculating heat buildup
                        over time, humidity, and individual household set points.
