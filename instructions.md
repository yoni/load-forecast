We're hoping you're willing to complete a short project for us. We think it'll give you a better understanding of the kinds of problems we'd like you to work on should you end up here. It will also let us see your work on a representative mini-project from start to finish.

We'd like you to create a tool that visualizes the estimated heating and cooling load across the continental United States day-by-day for one week into the future. In particular, we'd like you to produce a map that is colored according to how many hours of heating and cooling you expect to occur each day. The presentation is ultimately up to you, but, for example, you could color in dark blue those regions expected to use the most AC and in dark orange those regions expected to use the most heat. Whatever format you ultimately choose should show heating and cooling loads changing regionally one day after the next for seven days into the future. (The "future" can start the day after you submit your work to us.)

You will obviously need to make and state your assumptions for estimating heating and cooling loads. We will be happy with a reasonable, simple methodology for these estimates. Please don't tear your hair out attempting a rigorous estimation method -- we don't want you to embark on a science project. Anything halfway sensible will suffice.

* The seven (or more, if you'd like) maps showing daily heating and cooling loads geographically
* The code for the tool you created to generate the visualizations (your preferred programming language is fine)
* A short statement of your simple methodology/assumptions for estimating heating and cooling loads

You will find the Weather Underground free developer API helpful, but you can use whatever data sources you'd like. This assignment is somewhat open-ended -- and deliberately so. Please feel free to ask for clarification or guidance whenever you feel the need.
